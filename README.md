## Hi there 👋

🌍 Digital Nomad · Data Whisperer · Innovation Enthusiast
Hey there! I’m Hilvia — an engineer in business innovation who finds patterns in chaos, transforms raw data into bold decisions, and believes that technology + empathy can change the world.
This space is where I build, learn, and share ideas that blend analytics, creativity, and purpose.

🧠 What keeps me curious:
How can we use data to tell stories that matter? How do we design tech that empowers, not replaces?
I'm constantly experimenting with answers.

🚀 What I’m building:
Projects that make connect with the customer, businesses more intelligent, and people more connected.

🤝 Open to:
Collaborations that mix tech, data, and heart. If you're creating something that matters, let’s talk.

🌸 Beyond the screen:
I'm a lover of books that awaken the soul, a seeker of spiritual truths, and a nostalgic fan of 80s and 90s series and films — from mystical adventures to classic comedies.

I once turned a spreadsheet into a life-changing decision. Yes, it had conditional formatting.
